There was no me.
I embodied her.
I became her.
Her fault was my fault.
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay

I’M SO FUCKING TIRED
She doesn’t let me sleep.
It’s psychological warfare.
My eyes grow heavy,
And I start to drift,
But I can’t trust falling asleep
Because it’s an injustice against her.
I’m leaving her alone.
She screams, cries:
How could you do this to me?
I only want to sleep.
Sleep is the comfort, my eyelids the barrier,
Curtains closing,
But the play never ends.
Sleep is the enemy of love.                          
There’s no way to talk about the creature 
without talking about Daddy. During the 
months of therapy that followed my broken 
fist and brokenness, my therapist asked 
me to consider:

“What it is about you that made you think 
this was okay?”                          
"Ya, dowtyr, the mor wondryng that thow 
hast for my lofe, the mor thu plesyst me."
Than this creatur durst non otherwyse do 
than sche was comawndyd in hir sowle.                          
But let me tell you about Daddy.                          
And than sche sent for hyr gostly fadyr, 
for sche had a thyng in conscyens whech 
sche had nevyr schewyd beforn that tyme 
in alle hyr lyfe.                          
I wanted to be broken.
I was in love.                          
“For the man in love, however, the fervor 
of love may be felt more violently that 
physical desire is. We ought never forget 
that in spite of the bliss love promises its 
first effect is one of turmoil and distress. 
Passion fulfilled itself provokes such 
violent agitation that the happiness 
involved, before being happiness to be 
enjoyed, is so great as to be more like 
its opposite, suffering. Its essence is to 
substitute for their persistent discontinuity 
a miraculous continuity between two beings. 
Yet this continuity is chiefly to be felt in the 
anguish of desire, when it is still 
inaccessible, still an important quivering 
yearning. A tranquil feeling of secure 
happiness can only mean the calm which 
follows the long storm of suffering.”
-George Bataille

And I told her:
“You look cute when you read poetry.” 
She looked up, smiled, pushed her hair 
over her ear, and started telling me 
about “Daddy.”                          
We spent the night watching movies and 
eating Cheetos. She told me everything 
and I started to lose myself.
