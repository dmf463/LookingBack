There was no me.
I embodied her.
I became her.
Her fault was my fault.
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay

I’M SO FUCKING TIRED
She doesn’t let me sleep.
It’s psychological warfare.
My eyes grow heavy,
And I start to drift,
But I can’t trust falling asleep
Because it’s an injustice against her.
I’m leaving her alone.
She screams, cries:
How could you do this to me?
I only want to sleep.
Sleep is the comfort, my eyelids the barrier,
Curtains closing,
But the play never ends.
Sleep is the enemy of love.                          
There’s no way to talk about the creature 
without talking about Daddy. During the 
months of therapy that followed my broken 
fist and brokenness, my therapist asked 
me to consider:

“What it is about you that made you think 
this was okay?”                          
"Ya, dowtyr, the mor wondryng that thow 
hast for my lofe, the mor thu plesyst me."
Than this creatur durst non otherwyse do 
than sche was comawndyd in hir sowle.
